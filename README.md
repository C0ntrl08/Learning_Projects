# Parking Management System

## Overview

The Parking Management System is a console-based application that allows users to manage vehicle parking. The system tracks parked vehicles, calculates parking fees, and handles user problems. The project is built with C# and is designed to be modular and extensible.

The project has been created to practice the C# Language with the OOP principles, as well as Lambda Expressions, Interfaces, Singletons, DRY, and KISS. I tried to implement Encapsulation, Polymorhism and some of the procedural programming methods as well. As in the repository shows, I have used a version control system to track the development process.

## Features

- **Park Vehicle**: Add a car or motorcycle to the parking lot.
- **Remove Vehicle**: Remove a vehicle from the parking lot and calculate the parking fee based on the parked duration.
- **List Parked Vehicles**: Display a list of all parked vehicles with their details.
